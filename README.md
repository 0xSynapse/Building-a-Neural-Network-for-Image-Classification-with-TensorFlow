# Building-a-Neural-Network-for-Image-Classification-with-TensorFlow
We would build and train a dense neural network on the Fashion MNIST dataset and evaluate its performance with some test samples. This project aims to impart the knowledge of the basic steps involved in building a neural network, working with TensorFlow 2, training a neural network, and make the learner comfortable with the cutting-edge technology - TensorFlow 2.
